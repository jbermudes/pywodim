PyWodim - A python module for the linux CD burning program wodim
Author: Jess Bermudes

=======================
 Usage 
=======================

pywodim.py [OPTIONS] [ISOFILE]
Burn a CD and ensure its data integrity using wodim

OPTIONS:
  --dev			the target burning device
  --pre			pre-burn verification of FILE's MD5 sum
  --post			post-burn verification of disc's MD5 sum
  --dummy			turns off drive's laser for test burn
  --help			display this help and exit
  --version		output version information and exit
  
When pywodim is ran as a python script, it can be used to burn a CD.
It can also be used as a module for integrating into your own projects.
See the listing of module functions and read the source for more information.
  
  
=========================
  Known Bugs
=========================
  
  The final eject does not work 100% of the time. 
  For some reason the drive is sometimes still in use even
  after a cool-down wait, so if it doesn't eject, let the program
  exit, then eject the disc.
  
 ========================= 
  Behind the Scenes
 =========================
 
	Pywodim is a Python module for burning an ISO file to disc using wodim
	Most of the heavy lifting is done by the following linux programs:
	
	wodim   - does the actual burning
	md5sum  - verifies data integrity
	mount   - checks for disc mount
	eject   - opens/closes drive tray
	volname - gets the disc's volume name
	mount	- for testing the status of a device mount
	grep	- for determining certain output results

	PyWodim also makes extensive use of the Linux CD-ROM
	standard as described in /usr/include/linux/cdrom.h
	in order to talk to the drive and query its status
	via ioctl commands.
